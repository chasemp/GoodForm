A Framework for the Automated Assessment of Software Project Health and SecurityIntroduction: The Imperative for Automated Software VettingIn the contemporary software development landscape, the reliance on open-source and third-party components is not merely a convenience but a foundational principle of modern engineering. The global software registry, npm, hosts over two million packages, a testament to the scale of code sharing that underpins development worldwide.1 While this collaborative ecosystem accelerates innovation, it simultaneously introduces profound and complex risks to the software supply chain. Organizations are increasingly exposed to vulnerabilities, maintenance liabilities, and even malicious attacks embedded within the dependencies they consume. The sheer volume of these components renders manual due diligence—a cornerstone of traditional risk management—ineffective and unscalable. Consequently, the need for a rigorous, data-driven, and fully automated framework for vetting software projects has become a critical imperative for maintaining security and operational stability.This report presents a comprehensive, multi-faceted framework of automatable criteria designed to judge a software project based on its online presence, version control history, codebase characteristics, and community ecosystem. The ultimate objective of this framework is to empower an automated agent to provide a human operator—such as a developer, architect, or security analyst—with a clear, high-level guidance of "reasonable," "questionable," or "unsafe" regarding the use of a given project. This assessment is structured around four primary pillars of risk, which represent the most common failure modes and threat vectors in the software supply chain.The Four Pillars of RiskThe evaluation methodology is built upon a comprehensive understanding of four distinct yet often interconnected categories of risk:Maliciousness: This category addresses the risk of intentional harm. It encompasses a spectrum of threats, from overt malware and ransomware embedded in a package to subtle, obfuscated backdoors designed to exfiltrate data or compromise a system. Detecting malicious intent requires a deep analysis of code for suspicious patterns, security vulnerabilities, and deceptive practices.Abandonment: Software that is no longer actively maintained poses a significant, passive threat. Abandoned projects, often referred to as "bit rot," accumulate unfixed bugs and, most critically, unpatched security vulnerabilities.2 A project may appear functional today but become a critical liability tomorrow when a new vulnerability is discovered in its code or dependencies with no maintainer available to issue a patch.Poor Practices: This pillar concerns the accumulation of technical debt and the absence of disciplined engineering processes. Projects characterized by poor practices are often unstable, difficult to maintain, and prone to latent bugs.3 Indicators include a lack of testing, inconsistent release cycles, complex and unreadable code, and poor dependency management, all of which compromise the software's long-term reliability and security.Immaturity: New and unproven software carries inherent risks. An immature project may lack a stable API, a significant user base to uncover edge-case bugs, or established governance and support structures.4 While not inherently negative, immaturity signifies a higher degree of uncertainty and a lack of the "battle-tested" resilience that comes with time and widespread adoption.This report systematically deconstructs each of these risk pillars into a set of discrete, quantifiable, and automatable criteria. The methodology progresses from high-level indicators of project vitality and sustainability to granular, code-level analysis of quality and security. By synthesizing these diverse data points into a unified scoring model, this framework provides a robust and repeatable process for making informed, risk-aware decisions in the complex modern software ecosystem.Section 1: Project Vitality and Sustainability AssessmentThis section details the criteria for identifying project abandonment and assessing long-term viability. These metrics serve as leading indicators of a project's overall health. A project that exhibits signs of neglect or instability at this level is unlikely to be a reliable or secure dependency, regardless of the apparent quality of its code at a single point in time. The continuous health of the development process and its community is a prerequisite for sustained quality and security.1.1. Development Cadence and ActivityThe rhythm of development activity within a project's version control system is its most fundamental vital sign. A steady, recent pulse of meaningful contributions suggests an active and engaged maintenance team, whereas a faint or non-existent pulse is a primary indicator of abandonment.2Time Since Last Commit: The most direct and immediate metric for activity is the duration since the last commit was made to the project's primary development branch (e.g., main or master). This can be easily retrieved via the hosting platform's API. A project that has not received any updates in many months, or even years, is a strong candidate for being classified as abandoned.2 While a mature and stable project may naturally see a slowdown in development, a complete cessation of activity over a long period is a significant red flag.Commit Frequency and Velocity: Beyond the last commit, it is crucial to analyze the historical pattern of contributions. By tracking the number of commits over rolling time windows (e.g., the last 30, 90, and 365 days), an automated system can build a profile of the project's activity level.6 Tools designed for repository monitoring, such as Netdata or GitDailies, provide analytics that visualize these trends.6 A healthy project typically demonstrates a consistent, ongoing stream of commits. It is important to contextualize this data; a decline in commit frequency for a mature project can be a sign of stability, whereas for a newer project, it may signal a loss of momentum.5 The key is to distinguish between a project that is stable and one that is stagnant.Commit Type Analysis: A sophisticated analysis must differentiate between substantive code changes and superficial updates. A project may appear active, but if its recent commit history consists solely of minor edits to documentation (e.g., README files) or trivial typo fixes, its core functionality is likely not being maintained. This requires parsing the diff of each commit to measure the lines of code added, modified, or deleted. This avoids the "quantity over quality" trap, where developers might push frequent, low-impact commits to appear productive.9 An automated system should prioritize commits that alter source code files over those that only touch markdown or configuration files.A project's development cadence is not a static property but a dynamic indicator that must be correlated with other signals. For example, a low commit frequency is not inherently negative if it is paired with a responsive issue tracker where maintainers are actively addressing user-reported bugs. By linking commit messages (e.g., "Fixes #123") to the issue tracker, it is possible to differentiate between a project in a deliberate "maintenance mode"—characterized by infrequent but targeted bug fixes—and a project that is truly abandoned, with a low commit rate and a growing backlog of unresolved issues. This requires the automated agent to synthesize data from both the Git repository and the issue tracking system to form a more nuanced and accurate assessment of the project's status.1.2. Community Engagement and ResponsivenessA project's issue tracker and pull request (PR) forums are its primary interface with the user and contributor community. The level of activity and, more importantly, the responsiveness of maintainers in these channels are powerful proxies for the quality of support one can expect and the overall health of the project's ecosystem.4Issue and PR Triage Time: A critical metric is the median time elapsed from the creation of an issue or pull request to the first meaningful response from a maintainer (i.e., not an automated bot comment). This can be calculated by analyzing the timestamps of comments on issues and PRs via the platform's API. Consistently long delays suggest that the project is not actively monitored or that the maintainers are overwhelmed, which is a risk for anyone relying on the software for timely bug fixes.Issue and PR Closure Rate: The ratio of closed issues and merged/closed PRs to the total number of open ones provides insight into the project's ability to manage its workload. A steadily growing backlog of unresolved issues is a clear sign of an inactive or under-resourced maintenance team.6 Monitoring this trend over time can reveal whether a project is keeping up with user feedback or falling behind.Pull Request Metrics: The PR lifecycle offers a wealth of data about a project's internal development health. Key metrics to track include the average time a PR remains open before being merged, the number of review comments per PR, and the overall merge rate.8 These indicators help identify bottlenecks in the review process and assess the collaborative efficiency of the development team.Sentiment Analysis of Discussions: The tone of communication within a project's community can be a valuable, albeit qualitative, signal. By employing Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools, it is possible to perform automated sentiment analysis on the text of issue comments and forum discussions.11 Services such as Microsoft's Cognitive Services Text Analytics API can analyze text and return a sentiment score, typically on a scale from 0 (negative) to 1 (positive).11 A persistent pattern of negative sentiment can indicate widespread user frustration with bugs or a lack of support, or it could signal a toxic community environment. Both are significant risks to the project's long-term sustainability and ability to attract new contributors. For an automated system, this data should be used to flag projects for human review rather than making a definitive judgment, as context is crucial.1.3. Contributor Base HealthThe structure and resilience of a project's contributor base are critical to its long-term survival. A project that is overly dependent on a single individual or a single company is exposed to significant "key person risk" and has a single point of failure should that person or company cease their involvement.2Number of Active Contributors: A simple but effective metric is a count of the unique authors who have contributed commits, created pull requests, or made meaningful comments on issues within a recent time frame (e.g., the last year). A healthy, sustainable project will typically attract and retain multiple active contributors.4Contributor Diversity: It is important to assess not just the number of contributors but also their affiliations. An analysis of the domain names in contributor email addresses or their stated affiliations on their profiles can reveal whether contributions are concentrated within a single organization. A project with a diverse base of contributors from various companies and independent developers is generally more resilient, as the maintenance burden is shared and the project is not subject to the strategic whims of a single corporate entity.12Bus Factor Calculation: The "bus factor" is a more formal measure of this risk, defined as the minimum number of team members that would need to "get hit by a bus" (i.e., suddenly disappear from the project) before development would stall due to a lack of essential knowledge.13 This can be algorithmically estimated from Git repository data. A common methodology involves analyzing the contribution history to determine the primary "owner" of each file, typically defined as the developer who has authored the most lines of code within that file. The algorithm then simulates the departure of the most knowledgeable contributors one by one, in descending order of the number of files they "own." The bus factor is the number of developers who must be removed before a critical threshold of the project's files (e.g., 50%) are left "orphaned," with no remaining knowledgeable contributor.14 A bus factor of one or two is a major risk flag, indicating a critical dependency on a very small number of individuals.The risk posed by a low bus factor, however, must be contextualized by the project's community engagement. A project's risk from knowledge concentration is primarily about the unavailability of that knowledge when a key person departs. A project with a vibrant and highly responsive community, as measured by fast issue response times and high engagement on forums, possesses a distributed network of "power users" and potential future contributors. This engaged community can act as a buffer; if a key maintainer leaves, these community members can step in to answer questions, triage new issues, and even review simple pull requests. Their collective, albeit less deep, knowledge forms a crucial safety net that mitigates the immediate impact of the departure. Therefore, an automated assessment should not view these metrics in isolation. A project with a bus factor of two but a median issue response time of under 24 hours may be less risky than a project with a bus factor of three but a response time of over 30 days. The scoring model should account for this interaction, potentially down-weighting the risk of a low bus factor if community engagement metrics are exceptionally strong.1.4. Governance and DocumentationClear, publicly accessible documentation regarding a project's governance, contribution processes, and code of conduct are hallmarks of a mature, well-managed, and welcoming open-source project. The absence of such artifacts suggests an ad-hoc management style, which can create uncertainty and act as a significant barrier to entry for potential new contributors.4Presence of Key Files: An automated check should verify the existence and non-emptiness of several key files in the root of the repository. These include:README.md: The primary entry point for any user or developer.CONTRIBUTING.md: A file that explains how to contribute to the project, including setup instructions and process guidelines.CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md: A document that sets the standards for behavior within the community, fostering an inclusive environment.GOVERNANCE.md: A file that documents the project's leadership structure and decision-making processes.Documentation Recency: It is not enough for these files to simply exist; they must also be current. The date of the last commit that modified key documentation files should be checked. Stale documentation can be as misleading and harmful as no documentation at all.README Quality: The quality of the main README.md file can be heuristically assessed by parsing it for the presence of essential sections that indicate comprehensive setup and usage instructions, such as "Installation," "Usage," "Configuration," and "API Reference."Section 2: Development Practices and Codebase MaturityThis section transitions from external signals of project health to an internal examination of the development practices and the intrinsic quality of the codebase itself. The criteria here are designed to identify projects that suffer from poor engineering discipline, a lack of quality assurance, or general immaturity. These factors are strong indicators of a project's potential for instability, maintainability issues, and hidden defects.2.1. Release Management and Versioning DisciplineA formal, predictable, and well-documented release process is a critical sign of a mature software project. It provides consumers with confidence, stability, and a clear path for managing updates and understanding changes. Adherence to established standards like Semantic Versioning (SemVer) is a non-negotiable characteristic of a professionally managed project.4Release Frequency and Recency: The project's history of formal releases can be queried via the hosting platform's API by listing its tags or release objects. A project with no formal releases, relying instead on users to pull directly from the main branch, should be considered immature. Similarly, a project whose last formal release was several years ago may be effectively abandoned, even if there is minor commit activity.5Changelog Presence and Quality: A well-maintained CHANGELOG.md file is essential for transparency. An automated check should verify its existence and parse its contents to ensure that it is updated in conjunction with each new version tag. A changelog that lags far behind the latest release indicates poor release discipline.Semantic Versioning (SemVer) Compliance: SemVer is a specification that provides a universal and meaningful structure for version numbers (e.g., MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH). It allows consumers to understand the nature of changes between releases at a glance (breaking changes, new features, bug fixes). For each release tag found, its version string (e.g., v1.2.3) should be validated against the SemVer specification using a dedicated parsing library, such as composer/semver for PHP projects.17 The use of non-compliant or ambiguous versioning schemes (e.g., v1.2-final, v2025.01.10) is a strong indicator of immaturity.2.2. Static Code Quality MetricsThe intrinsic quality of the source code is a direct measure of its long-term maintainability, its susceptibility to bugs, and the ease with which it can be understood and modified by developers.3 These metrics can be calculated automatically by a wide range of language-specific static analysis tools.Cyclomatic Complexity: This metric measures the structural complexity of a program by counting the number of linearly independent paths through its source code. A function with a high cyclomatic complexity has many branches and loops, making it difficult to understand, test thoroughly, and maintain.3 A high average cyclomatic complexity across the entire codebase is a significant "poor practice" flag, indicating a high likelihood of hidden bugs and a heavy maintenance burden.Maintainability Index: This is a composite metric that calculates a single score representing the relative ease of maintaining the code. It typically incorporates factors like cyclomatic complexity, lines of code, and Halstead complexity measures. A low maintainability index is a strong indicator of significant technical debt.3Code Duplication: This metric measures the percentage of code that is duplicated within the codebase. A high level of duplication is a sign of poor design ("copy-paste programming") and significantly increases maintenance costs, as a bug in one section of duplicated code must be fixed in all of its copies.3Defect Density: This provides a normalized measure of code quality by calculating the number of potential defects (as identified by a static analysis tool) per thousand lines of code (KLOC). This allows for a more equitable comparison of code quality between projects of different sizes.32.3. Test Suite Adequacy and QualityA project's commitment to automated testing is one of the most powerful indicators of its reliability and the development team's discipline. However, a simple measure of test coverage can be easily gamed and is often a misleading proxy for quality. A more sophisticated analysis must assess not just that code is tested, but that it is tested effectively.Test Coverage Percentage: As a baseline metric, the percentage of source code lines that are executed by the automated test suite should be measured. This data can be parsed from reports generated by common code coverage tools like Codecov.3 While not a definitive measure of quality, a project with very low test coverage (e.g., below 70%) is demonstrably lacking in quality assurance and should be flagged as "questionable."Mutation Test Score: For a much deeper and more accurate assessment of test suite quality, mutation testing should be employed. Mutation testing frameworks, such as Stryker for JavaScript/TypeScript or PIT for Java, work by automatically introducing small, deliberate faults (called "mutants") into the source code.19 For example, a mutant might change a > operator to a >=. The project's test suite is then run against each mutant. If a test fails, the mutant is considered "killed," meaning the test suite was effective enough to detect the change. If all tests pass, the mutant "survives," indicating a weakness in the test suite. The final mutation score is calculated as the percentage of killed mutants out of the total number of non-equivalent mutants.20The mutation score serves as a powerful litmus test for genuine testing discipline. Many projects may boast high test coverage, but this can be achieved with trivial tests that only execute code without making meaningful assertions about its behavior. This practice of "testing for coverage" results in a test suite that provides a false sense of security. Mutation testing directly challenges this. A test suite developed with true Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles, where tests are written to fail first and then made to pass by implementing the correct logic, will naturally be robust against small behavioral changes and will therefore kill a high percentage of mutants. Conversely, a weak test suite will allow many mutants to survive. A low mutation score, even in the presence of high code coverage, is a definitive indicator of an ineffective test suite and a significant "poor practice" flag.2.4. Dependency Management HygieneThe manner in which a project manages its external dependencies is a reflection of its maturity and its understanding of software supply chain security and stability.Number of Dependencies: While not a direct flaw, a project with an excessively large number of dependencies (especially transitive dependencies) has a larger attack surface and a greater maintenance burden. This should be considered as a contributing risk factor.Pinned vs. Ranged Versions: The project's package manifest files (package.json, requirements.txt, pom.xml, etc.) should be analyzed. The use of pinned, specific versions (e.g., library==1.2.3) provides determinism and stability, ensuring that builds are repeatable. Conversely, the use of wide version ranges (e.g., library>=1.0.0 or library:*) can be dangerous, as it can automatically pull in new major versions of a dependency that may contain breaking changes or new vulnerabilities without warning.Use of Dependency Automation: The presence of configuration files for automated dependency update tools, such as dependabot.yml for GitHub's Dependabot, is a positive signal. It indicates that the project has a proactive, automated process for staying informed about and integrating updates to its dependencies, including security patches.182.5. Advanced Codebase Analysis (AI/NLP-driven)The textual artifacts within a repository, particularly commit messages, hold a rich, machine-readable history of the project's development discipline, communication practices, and areas of instability.Commit Message Quality: The quality of commit messages can be programmatically assessed using NLP techniques.21 An automated analysis can check for adherence to established conventions (e.g., Conventional Commits, which prefixes messages with types like feat:, fix:, chore:), as well as general clarity and descriptiveness. The development of AI-powered tools like GitPoet, which can generate high-quality commit messages from a code diff, demonstrates the feasibility of this analysis.23 A long history of vague, uninformative commit messages (e.g., "fixes," "update," "stuff") indicates poor communication practices and makes the project history difficult to audit or debug.Code Churn Analysis: Code churn is a metric that measures the percentage of code that is rewritten, modified, or deleted shortly after being committed.9 While some churn is natural during iterative development, an excessively high churn rate in certain files or modules can indicate underlying problems such as code instability, unclear requirements, or a pattern of rushed, low-quality pull requests. Tools like the "Git History Analyzer" can be used to identify these "hotspots" in the codebase by analyzing the Git history.24There is a direct causal relationship between poor commit message quality and high code churn. A commit message is the primary record of the intent behind a code change.21 When a message is vague, other developers—or even the original author months later—lack the necessary context to understand why a particular change was made. This lack of context inevitably leads to mistakes when modifying or building upon that code, such as re-introducing a previously fixed bug or violating an implicit assumption. These mistakes then necessitate follow-up commits to fix the new problems, which is the very definition of code churn. Therefore, an automated system can and should treat a high frequency of low-quality commit messages as a leading indicator of future code instability and rework. This allows the system to flag a "poor practice" risk even before the churn becomes statistically significant in the repository's history.Section 3: Security Posture and Malicious Code AnalysisThis section provides a multi-layered framework for identifying security vulnerabilities and potential malicious intent. The approach moves from detecting known, documented risks to employing heuristic-based analysis to uncover novel or deliberately hidden threats. A project's security posture is a direct measure of its safety for consumption.3.1. Dependency Vulnerability ScanningA project is only as secure as its most vulnerable dependency. The automated scanning of a project's dependency tree for known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) is the most fundamental and critical security check.CVE Scanning: The analysis must integrate a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool, such as the open-source OWASP Dependency-Check, which scans a project's declared dependencies and cross-references them with the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) to identify any known vulnerabilities.25Vulnerability Scoring: For every CVE identified, its severity must be assessed. This is achieved by retrieving its Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score, a standardized rating from 0 to 10, from the NVD's API.26 The presence of any dependency with a CVE that has a "CRITICAL" (9.0-10.0) or "HIGH" (7.0-8.9) CVSS score should be treated as a major "unsafe" flag.Build Integration: A mature project will integrate such scanning directly into its continuous integration (CI) pipeline, for example, via a Maven or Gradle plugin.25 The presence of such a configuration is a positive indicator of a proactive security posture.3.2. Hardcoded Secret and Credential DetectionThe act of committing sensitive information—such as API keys, passwords, private certificates, or authentication tokens—directly into a version control repository is a critical and surprisingly common security failure. These secrets, once committed, can be discovered by malicious actors and used to compromise systems.History Scanning: It is not sufficient to scan only the current version of the code. Malicious actors frequently scan the entire commit history of public repositories for secrets that were accidentally committed and later removed. Therefore, the automated analysis must employ tools like Gitleaks or Trufflehog, which are designed to scan the full Git history of a repository.28 These tools use a combination of high-precision regular expressions for known secret formats and entropy analysis to detect high-entropy strings that are likely to be cryptographic keys.Real-time Prevention: A project that demonstrates a high level of security maturity may employ pre-commit hooks that run secret scanners locally on a developer's machine before a commit is even created. The presence of such configurations (e.g., in a .pre-commit-config.yaml file) is a strong positive signal of preventative security controls.28Severity: The detection of any hardcoded secret, particularly credentials for major cloud providers (e.g., AWS access keys), code hosting platforms (e.g., GitHub personal access tokens), or other critical services, should immediately and unequivocally flag the project as "unsafe."3.3. Static Application Security Testing (SAST) for Common WeaknessesStatic Application Security Testing (SAST) involves analyzing a project's own source code for common security vulnerability patterns without executing the program.30 This technique is effective at uncovering a wide range of flaws that could be exploited by an attacker, such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), insecure deserialization, and the use of weak cryptographic algorithms.SAST Tool Integration: The framework should integrate one or more modern SAST tools to perform a comprehensive scan of the codebase. Open-source tools like Semgrep or powerful engines like GitHub's CodeQL provide configurable rule sets to detect a vast array of potential vulnerabilities.18OWASP Top 10 Alignment: The findings from the SAST scan should be categorized according to well-established vulnerability frameworks, such as the OWASP Top Ten.31 The presence of vulnerabilities that could lead to high-impact exploits, such as Remote Code Execution (RCE) or SQL Injection, should be treated as an "unsafe" flag.False Positive Consideration: It is important to acknowledge that SAST tools are known to produce a significant number of false positives—warnings that do not represent actual vulnerabilities.31 A robust scoring model should account for this, potentially by weighting the severity of a finding based on the tool's reported confidence level or by focusing on vulnerability classes that have a lower false positive rate.3.4. Detection of Suspicious and Obfuscated CodeMalicious actors do not want their code to be easily discovered or understood. They frequently employ obfuscation techniques to hide the true intent of their code from both human analysts and automated security tools. The detection of such patterns is a powerful heuristic for identifying potentially malicious code, even in the absence of a known vulnerability signature.34Abnormally High Cyclomatic Complexity: While high complexity is often a sign of poor code quality, an extremely high complexity score in a specific function can be an indicator of an obfuscation technique known as control-flow flattening. This technique deliberately complicates the control-flow graph to make it unreadable. An automated system should set a very high threshold for this metric to specifically flag it as a potential obfuscation indicator rather than just a quality issue.34Instruction Overlapping: This is a classic obfuscation technique used by malware packers and obfuscators to confuse and crash disassemblers. It involves creating opaque control transfers to addresses that fall in the middle of other valid instructions. An automated check can be performed by iterating through all instructions in a disassembled binary and ensuring that no two instructions occupy the same byte addresses. The presence of instruction overlapping is a very strong signal of intentional obfuscation and should be treated as a high-severity "unsafe" flag.34String Obfuscation Patterns: Malicious code often hides strings (such as IP addresses, domain names, or commands) by encrypting or encoding them and then decoding them at runtime. Heuristic scanners can be designed to detect common string decoding loop patterns (e.g., sequences of MOV-XOR-MOV instructions) or the presence of known cryptographic constants that are frequently used in these decryption routines.36Use of Packers and Crypters: Malware is often compressed or encrypted using tools known as packers or crypters to evade signature-based antivirus detection. Automated tools can scan for the unique signatures or artifacts left by these common packing tools.35The most powerful signal for malicious intent arises not from a single indicator but from the correlation of multiple, distinct suspicious patterns. Any single heuristic can have a benign explanation; for example, extremely complex code could be a legitimate cryptographic algorithm, not obfuscation. However, the probability of multiple such indicators co-occurring by chance is extremely low. A truly malicious package is likely to exhibit a cluster of red flags. For instance, it might combine obfuscated code with the use of dependencies that have known remote code execution vulnerabilities and be published by a newly created, anonymous maintainer account. An effective automated assessment agent should not simply sum the risk scores of individual security findings. It must implement a "combination bonus" for risk. If flags are triggered across multiple, orthogonal security categories (e.g., SAST, Obfuscation Detection, and Secret Scanning) simultaneously, the project's overall risk score should be amplified exponentially, immediately escalating its classification to "unsafe." This approach models the way a human security analyst connects disparate pieces of evidence to identify a credible and sophisticated threat.3.5. License and Compliance AnalysisThe software license under which a project is distributed determines the legal terms of its use, modification, and redistribution. Missing, ambiguous, or conflicting licenses create significant legal and compliance risks for any individual or organization that consumes the software.License File Presence: A basic check must verify the existence of a LICENSE or LICENSE.md file in the root of the repository. Its absence is a "questionable" flag, as it creates legal ambiguity.License Identification: The contents of the license file should be parsed to identify its standard name, preferably its Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX) identifier (e.g., MIT, Apache-2.0, GPL-3.0-only). Tools such as the SPDX-tools can automate this identification process.37 An unrecognized, custom, or ambiguous license creates risk and requires manual legal review.Dependency License Compatibility: A comprehensive analysis must scan not only the project's license but also the licenses of all its direct and transitive dependencies. This is crucial for identifying license conflicts. For example, using a library with a "copyleft" license like the GPL in a project that is intended to be distributed under a permissive license like MIT can create unintended and severe legal obligations for downstream users.10Section 4: A Unified Scoring Framework for Automated AssessmentThe final and most critical step in this framework is to synthesize the dozens of quantitative metrics gathered in the preceding sections into a practical, actionable model. This model must translate the complex, multi-dimensional data into the simple, qualitative judgment required by the end-user: "reasonable," "questionable," or "unsafe." This is achieved through a systematic mapping of criteria, a weighted scoring system, and the definition of clear classification thresholds.4.1. Defining the Assessment Dimensions and Mapping CriteriaThe first step is to formally map every measurable criterion from Sections 1, 2, and 3 to one of the four primary risk categories. This creates a structured ontology that forms the basis of the scoring model. The following table, the Comprehensive Project Assessment Matrix, serves as the definitive blueprint for implementing the analysis agent. It provides a single, comprehensive reference for every automatable criterion, detailing its purpose, data source, interpretation, and severity.CriterionRisk CategoryData Source / ToolMetric to MeasureInterpretation Guidance (Thresholds)Proposed Severity WeightSource(s)Project Vitality & SustainabilityTime Since Last CommitAbandonmentGitHub/GitLab APIDays since last commit to default branch> 365 days = High Risk; > 180 days = Medium RiskHigh2Commit FrequencyAbandonmentGit History AnalysisAverage commits per week (90-day window)< 1 = Medium RiskMedium6Issue Closure RateAbandonmentGitHub/GitLab APIRatio of (closed_issues / total_issues)< 0.5 and > 50 open issues = High RiskHigh6Median Issue Triage TimeAbandonmentGitHub/GitLab APIMedian hours to first maintainer response> 336h (2 weeks) = High RiskHigh9Bus FactorAbandonmentGit History Analysis (e.g., git-truck)Integer count of key developers1 = High Risk; 2 = Medium RiskHigh13Contributor DiversityAbandonmentGit History Analysis (email domains)Percentage of commits from dominant org> 90% = Medium RiskMedium12Documentation PresenceImmaturityFile System CheckBoolean presence of README, CONTRIBUTINGMissing CONTRIBUTING.md = Low RiskLow4Development Practices & MaturityRelease RecencyImmaturityGitHub/GitLab API (Tags/Releases)Days since last formal release> 730 days (2 years) = High RiskHigh5SemVer ComplianceImmaturitySemVer Parsing Library (e.g., composer/semver)Percentage of release tags that are valid SemVer< 90% = Medium RiskMedium17Average Cyclomatic ComplexityPoor PracticesStatic Analysis Tool (e.g., SonarQube, PMD)Average complexity score per function> 15 = Medium RiskMedium3Code DuplicationPoor PracticesStatic Analysis ToolPercentage of duplicated lines> 10% = Medium RiskMedium3Test CoveragePoor PracticesCoverage Report Parser (e.g., Codecov API)Percentage of lines covered by tests< 70% = Medium Risk; < 40% = High RiskMedium3Mutation Test ScorePoor PracticesMutation Tester (e.g., Stryker, PIT)Percentage of mutants killed by tests< 80% = High RiskHigh19Commit Message QualityPoor PracticesNLP Analysis (e.g., Conventional Commits check)Percentage of non-compliant/vague messages> 50% = Medium RiskMedium21High Code Churn FilesPoor PracticesGit History AnalyzerCount of files with >50% churn in 30 days> 5 files = Medium RiskMedium9Security Posture & MaliciousnessCritical/High Severity CVEsMaliciousness/UnsafeSCA Tool (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check) + NVD APICount of dependencies with CVSS score >= 7.0> 0 = High RiskHigh25Hardcoded Secrets in HistoryMaliciousness/UnsafeSecret Scanner (e.g., Gitleaks, Trufflehog)Count of verified secrets found in full history> 0 = Critical RiskCritical28High-Impact SAST FindingsMaliciousness/UnsafeSAST Tool (e.g., Semgrep, CodeQL)Count of findings in RCE, SQLi, Auth Bypass categories> 0 = High RiskHigh31Obfuscation (Instruction Overlap)Maliciousness/UnsafeDisassembler-based HeuristicBoolean detection of overlapping instructionsTrue = Critical RiskCritical34Obfuscation (String Decoding)Maliciousness/UnsafeHeuristic Pattern ScannerBoolean detection of common decoding loopsTrue = High RiskHigh36License PresenceImmaturityFile System CheckBoolean presence of LICENSE fileFalse = Medium RiskMedium10License Compatibility IssuesPoor PracticesLicense Analysis Tool (e.g., SPDX-tools)Boolean detection of conflicting licensesTrue = High RiskHigh104.2. A Weighted Scoring ModelNot all identified risks carry the same weight. A hardcoded AWS administrative key is an existential threat, whereas a missing CONTRIBUTING.md file is a minor inconvenience. The scoring model must reflect this reality by assigning weights to each criterion based on its potential impact.Severity Tiers: Each metric is assigned to one of four severity tiers, which act as multipliers in the final score calculation:Critical: These are "showstopper" issues that represent a clear and present danger. The presence of a single Critical-risk item should immediately render a project "unsafe." Examples include a verified hardcoded secret or the use of known malware packers. These are assigned a weight that effectively overrides all other scores.High: These are serious issues that indicate significant risk or a fundamental lack of quality or security. They strongly push a project toward a "questionable" or "unsafe" classification. Examples include a dependency with a high-severity CVE, a bus factor of 1, or a very low mutation test score.Medium: These are indicators of poor practices, immaturity, or potential future risk. While not immediate threats, a collection of Medium-risk items suggests a project is poorly managed and unreliable. Examples include low test coverage, inconsistent release schedules, or high code complexity.Low: These are minor issues that, while not ideal, do not pose a significant risk to the project's usability or security. They serve as tie-breakers or indicators of overall project polish. An example is a history of non-standard commit messages.Scoring Formula: A total risk score can be calculated using a formula that incorporates the measured value of each metric, its assigned weight, and its severity. A simplified model could be represented as:TotalRiskScore=∑(MetricValuenormalized​×Weightcategory​×SeverityMultiplier)Where MetricValue_normalized is the output of the metric scaled to a common range (e.g., 0 to 1), and SeverityMultiplier is a value assigned to each tier (e.g., Critical=1000, High=10, Medium=3, Low=1).4.3. Thresholds for ClassificationWith a TotalRiskScore calculated, the final step is to define the boundaries that map this quantitative score to the qualitative, human-readable classifications.Unsafe: A project is classified as "unsafe" if:Any metric with a "Critical" severity weight is triggered.OR the TotalRiskScore exceeds a high threshold (e.g., > 80 on a 100-point scale).This classification indicates the presence of active, verifiable risks that pose a direct threat to the security or stability of any system using the software.Questionable: A project is classified as "questionable" if:No "Critical" flags are triggered, but multiple "High" severity flags are present, or there is a large accumulation of "Medium" severity flags.The TotalRiskScore falls within a medium band (e.g., 30-80).This classification indicates that the project has significant deficiencies in quality, maintenance, or security that warrant a thorough manual review before it can be considered for use.Reasonable: A project is classified as "reasonable" if:No "Critical" or "High" severity flags are triggered, and there are only a few "Medium" or "Low" severity flags.The TotalRiskScore is below a low threshold (e.g., < 30).This classification indicates that the project appears to be actively maintained, follows good engineering and security practices, and does not present any immediate, obvious risks.4.4. Generating Actionable ReportsThe final output of the automated agent should not be just a label but a concise, justified report that empowers the human user to make a quick and informed decision. The report should be structured as follows:The Final Assessment: A clear, top-level statement of "Reasonable," "Questionable," or "Unsafe."Executive Summary: A one- or two-sentence summary explaining the primary reasons for the assessment. For example, "Unsafe: Project contains hardcoded AWS credentials in its commit history and has a critical vulnerability (CVE-2025-XXXX) in a core dependency."Key Contributing Factors: A bulleted list of the top 3-5 specific findings that most heavily influenced the score. This allows the user to immediately focus on the most important issues without needing to parse the full data set.Link to Detailed Report: A hyperlink to a comprehensive report containing the raw values and status for every measured criterion, allowing for deeper investigation if required.ConclusionThe framework detailed in this report provides a comprehensive, multi-layered, and, most importantly, fully automatable methodology for assessing the health and security of software projects. It moves beyond simplistic, single-metric evaluations to create a holistic picture of risk, encompassing project vitality, development discipline, codebase quality, and security posture. By translating dozens of complex, quantitative data points into a clear, qualitative assessment, this system empowers organizations to manage the inherent risks of the modern software supply chain at scale.The key to this framework's effectiveness lies not merely in the measurement of individual criteria but in the understanding of their interplay and context. A low commit frequency is contextualized by issue tracker responsiveness to distinguish between stable maintenance and outright abandonment. High test coverage is scrutinized by mutation testing to separate true quality assurance from superficial compliance. Isolated security warnings are correlated to identify the clustered patterns indicative of sophisticated, malicious intent.This data-driven approach replaces ambiguity and manual effort with objective, repeatable, and scalable analysis. The implementation of such an automated vetting system is no longer a luxury but a necessity for any organization serious about securing its software development lifecycle. As the complexity and velocity of software development continue to increase, the future of supply chain security will be defined by the ability to perform this kind of deep, automated due diligence on every component, every commit, and every release.
