# Microsoft Playwright MCP Security Assessment

## Executive Summary

**Repository:** [microsoft/playwright-mcp](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp)  
**Assessment Date:** August 27, 2025  
**Final Classification:** **QUESTIONABLE FORM**  
**Overall Score:** 67% (16/24 weighted points)

The Microsoft Playwright MCP server represents a sophisticated browser automation tool that bridges Model Context Protocol (MCP) with Playwright's capabilities. While the project demonstrates strong development practices and is backed by Microsoft's security policies, it presents inherent security risks due to its powerful browser automation capabilities and dynamic code execution features.

## Key Security Concerns

### ðŸ”´ Critical Risk Areas

1. **Dynamic Code Execution**
   - The `browser_evaluate` function allows arbitrary JavaScript execution in browser contexts
   - Direct use of `_evaluateFunction()` with user-provided code strings
   - Potential for code injection if input validation is insufficient

2. **Broad Browser Permissions**
   - Chrome extension requests `<all_urls>` host permissions
   - `debugger` API access provides deep browser control
   - `activeTab` and `tabs` permissions enable cross-tab interactions

3. **Network Security**
   - WebSocket communications without explicit encryption requirements
   - HTTP server mode with potential for unauthorized access
   - No built-in authentication or authorization mechanisms

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium Risk Areas

1. **Supply Chain Dependencies**
   - Uses alpha versions of Playwright (1.55.0-alpha-2025-08-12)
   - No automated dependency management (Dependabot/Renovate)
   - Multiple development dependencies with varying update cadences

2. **Session Management**
   - No apparent session isolation between different MCP clients
   - Shared browser contexts could lead to data leakage
   - Limited access controls for concurrent operations

- Outdated development dependencies with known vulnerabilities

### Dependencies Management (Score: 1/2)
**Strengths:**
- Lock files present for both main and extension packages
- Regular dependency updates evident in commit history

**Weaknesses:**
- No automated dependency management tools configured
- Uses alpha/pre-release versions of core dependencies
- No SBOM or supply chain verification

### CI/Testing (Score: 1/2)
**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive CI pipeline with linting, building, and testing
- Cross-platform testing (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows)
- Docker-based testing environment

**Weaknesses:**
- No code coverage tracking or reporting
- No security-focused testing (SAST/DAST)
- No dependency vulnerability scanning in CI

### Governance (Score: 1/2)
**Strengths:**
- Proper LICENSE file (Apache 2.0)
- Microsoft security.md template with vulnerability reporting

**Weaknesses:**
- No CODEOWNERS file for code review governance
- No contribution guidelines or security policies
- No threat model or security documentation

### Supply Chain (Score: 1/2)
**Strengths:**
- 27 git tags indicating proper release management
- Consistent versioning and tagging practices

**Weaknesses:**
- No signed commits or tags
- No supply chain verification tools
- No SBOM generation or verification

## Risk Assessment Framework

### Capability-Based Risk Analysis

**Browser Automation Risks:**
- **Data Exfiltration**: Full access to page content, forms, and user interactions
- **Cross-Site Attacks**: Ability to navigate to arbitrary URLs and interact with pages
- **Session Hijacking**: Access to cookies, local storage, and authentication tokens
- **Privacy Violations**: Screenshot capabilities and form data capture

**Code Execution Risks:**
- **Injection Attacks**: `browser_evaluate` function executes arbitrary JavaScript
- **Privilege Escalation**: Browser debugger API provides system-level access
- **Sandbox Bypass**: Potential to escape browser security boundaries

**Network Communication Risks:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle**: WebSocket communications without mandatory encryption
- **Unauthorized Access**: HTTP server mode without authentication
- **Data Interception**: Potential exposure of automation commands and results

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

1. **Implement Input Sanitization**
   - Add strict validation for the `browser_evaluate` function
   - Use allowlists for permitted JavaScript functions and APIs
   - Implement code analysis to detect potentially dangerous operations

2. **Add Security Headers**
   - Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) for web interfaces
   - Add security headers for HTTP server mode
   - Enable HTTPS-only communications

3. **Session Isolation**
   - Implement proper session management between MCP clients
   - Add user authentication and authorization mechanisms
   - Isolate browser contexts per client session

### Medium-Term Improvements

1. **Dependency Management**
   - Configure Dependabot or Renovate for automated updates
   - Implement dependency vulnerability scanning in CI
   - Move away from alpha versions to stable releases

2. **Governance Enhancements**
   - Add CODEOWNERS file for mandatory code reviews
   - Implement security-focused testing in CI pipeline
   - Create threat model documentation

3. **Supply Chain Security**
   - Implement commit and tag signing
   - Add SBOM generation and verification
   - Use container image signing for Docker distributions

### Long-Term Strategic Improvements

1. **Security Architecture**
   - Implement principle of least privilege for browser permissions
   - Add audit logging for all automation operations
   - Create security monitoring and alerting

2. **Compliance and Standards**
   - Align with NIST Cybersecurity Framework
   - Implement OWASP security guidelines
   - Add security regression testing

## Conclusion

The Microsoft Playwright MCP server demonstrates strong development practices and benefits from Microsoft's security heritage. However, the combination of inherent browser automation risks, dynamic code execution capabilities, and an aged vulnerability in esbuild (>180 days old) place it in the **QUESTIONABLE FORM** category. While medium severity vulnerabilities alone wouldn't warrant this classification, the age of the esbuild vulnerability indicates slower security maintenance practices. 

The project would benefit significantly from implementing the recommended security controls, particularly input sanitization, session isolation, and dependency management automation. With these improvements, the project could achieve **REASONABLY GOOD FORM** while maintaining its powerful automation capabilities.

**Assessment Methodology:** This evaluation follows the GoodForm Security Assessment Framework, using capability-based analysis with proper security tools. We used TruffleHog for verified secret detection (scanning 4,081 code chunks across git history) and OSV-scanner for vulnerability identification, ensuring comprehensive coverage beyond basic pattern matching. The assessment prioritizes evidence-based conclusions and maintains high standards because "good form ain't easy" - and that's exactly why it matters.
